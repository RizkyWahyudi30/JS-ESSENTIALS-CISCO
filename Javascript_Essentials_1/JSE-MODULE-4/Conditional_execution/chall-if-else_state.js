//  summarize whatâ€™s going on, we can dissect each case separately:

//     if userAge is less than 21 and hasParentsApproval is false, the order is invalid;
//     If userAge is less than 21 but hasParentsApproval is set to true, the shippingCost will be reduced by 5;
//     If userAge is 65 or higher, shippingCost is reduced to zero;
//     If userAge is lower than 65, but higher than or equal to 21 AND one of the following:
//     - hasParentsApproval is equal to true;
//     - cartValue is greater than 300;
//     - points is greater than 500;
//     the shippingCost is reduced to zero.

// In any other case, the cost remains at the default value.

// After all of this, we do another check:

//     if addInsurance is set to true;
//     AND in addition orderIsValid;
//     AND hasPromoCode is not true, then we add INSURANCE_COST to the shippingValue.

// In the end, we display the shippingCost if the order is valid, and the message if it is not.

// Take your time with this example, and play with the values to understand what is happening and how.
