    <h3>// 3.2.4 SECTION PRACTICE</h3>
    <p>
      // Exercise: Using everything youâ€™ve learned up until this point, write a
      script that asks a user about the width, height, and length of a box, then
      calculate and return to the user the volume of this box.
    </p>
    <p>
      // As an example, a box with width = 20, height = 10, and length = 50 will
      have a volume of 10000 (omitting units, as they are not relevant in this
      scenario). For now, assume that the values provided by the user are valid
      numbers, but if you have any ideas on how, you can try to make this script
      in such a way that it will be resistant to invalid values.s
    </p>

    <script>
      let width = prompt("Volume of the box, enter witdth", 0);
      let height = prompt("Volumen of the box, enter height", 0);
      let length = prompt("Volumen the box, enter length", 0);
      let volume = width * height * length;
      alert(`Calculated box volume is: ${volume}`);
